EXERCISES:
1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching 
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of 
steps it would take? 
7 steps.

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum 
number of steps now?
8 steps.

Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O:
1.3 You have a name, and you want to ind the person’s phone number 
in the phone book. 
O(logn)

1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to ind the person’s name 
in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole 
book!)
O(n)

1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.
O(n)

1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (his is a tricky one! 
It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4. Read the 
answer—you may be surprised!)
